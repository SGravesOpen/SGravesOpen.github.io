This was the game I made to accompany my senior research project during undergrad. A simple mario clone, this game was themed on the plantation that the college was historically built near.

I amde this game via Godot, an open-source game engine most often comapred to Unity. This engine offered some flexibility in its scripting, but its default language was its own GDScript, which, in practice, was based largely on Python, which I had experience with already. While I had never coded an actual game before, Godot's documentation and the small scope I kept the game to made this mostly a non-issue.
