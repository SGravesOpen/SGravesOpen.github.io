Back in the summer of 2019, I worked as a research assistant at Brown University in cooperation with NASA to create a virtual reality recreation of the Chandra spaceship for the oculus Rift. This was done in Unity by myself, my colleague, and our supervisor/mentor. 

Coming into this research assignment, I was unfamiliar with both Unity and any sort of VR hardware; While Unity's use of C was easy enough to grasp, working around the abilities of the hardware was the actual difficult part of the experience, in large part due to the lack of good documentation available to us at the time.
